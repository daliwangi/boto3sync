# boto3sync
sync local files with remote boto3 storage
Replace the fields with your own local path, your remote domain url, your access key and secret key in the file.
The script will automatically sync your remote storage with your local folder. Once there is a new file in your local folder, it will be transferred to the remote storage automatically.
If the remote folder contains a file that cannot be found in the local folder, it will be automatically downloaded there.
